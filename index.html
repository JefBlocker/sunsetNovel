    <h3>Chapter 1, Scene 1</h3>
    <h4>"Home Again"</h4>
    <p>“I just keep asking myself, ‘If you love me, then why did you do it?’” Jane said.  “If you really loved me, how could you sleep with someone else?”</p>
    <p>My eyes followed my dad on the riding lawnmower, as he criss-crossed the backyard with a precision only years of practice provided.  When I was younger, I had driven the same route on endless Saturday afternoons.</p>
    <p>“Are you there, Scott?”</p>
    <p></p>

I switched my iPhone from my left to my right ear.  I had only stepped outside a few minutes before, but the June humidity had already manifested itself in beads of sweat on my brow.  
“I don’t know what you want me to say.”  I cleared my throat.  “I told you I’m sorry and it will never happen again.  I don’t know what else to do.”
“I believe you … but I need to know why it happened in the first place.”
I wiped my brow and gazed at the sweat on the back of my hand, searching for an answer to the question I had asked myself ever since that night in the Los Angeles hotel.  
“Maybe I should come home and we can talk about it.”
“You can come back to New York, but you can’t come home,” Jane said.  “Not until you can give me an answer.”  She didn’t wait for a goodbye before she ended the call.  
Dad drove by and waved, grinning in his cowboy hat, camouflage shorts, and western boots.  
I waved back and smiled, even though this potential glimpse of my future combined with an inconsolable fiancee made me want to go back to bed for the rest of my life.  
Bits of loose grass clippings blew onto my phone and stuck to the moisture there.  As I wiped them off, a text arrived:
Owen Smallwood: Hungry?
Scott Schroeder: Hell yeah!
Owen Smallwood: Meet me at Casa de Owen at 7.
I opened the patio door and a blast of air conditioning chilled the perspiration on my forehead.  
“You hungry?” Mom peered at the pages of several cookbooks spread out before her while drumming a pencil with a Hello Kitty erase topper on the table.
“I’m going to grab some dinner with Owen.”
She turned a page and leaned closer to inspect close-up of a casserole.  “How is Owen?  Is he still puttering?”  
“If you mean is he still managing the Hole-in-One, then yes.”
Mom sat up and gazed over the top of her glasses.  “I can’t imagine putt-putt pays enough to support a family.”
“Considering Owen’s lack of social skills, I don’t think he’s in any danger or knocking some girl up.”
“That’s not funny, Scott.”  She licked a finger and turned another page.  “I believe there is someone for every one.”
“Maybe so,” I said, grabbing a can of Coke from the fridge, “but someone has to be willing to settle down first.”
“Are you speaking of Owen or yourself?”
I popped the can open and it seemed louder than usual in the silence.  “Jane and I are engaged.”
Mom removed her glasses and rested her elbows on the table.  “Then why are you here without her?”
I sipped some Coke.  “Just needed to get away from the big city.”
She removed her glasses and set them on the table.  “Is everything okay with you two?”
“Yeah, yeah … just, you know, pre-wedding jitters.”
Mom sighed.  “You know, if you need to talk, you can tell your Daddy and me anything.”
I swished the soda around my mouth and swallowed.  “I know.”
Blaring hard rock music and churning gravel announced the return of my big brother.  
“I’ve got to go.”  I grabbed the keys to Mom's SUV, kissed Mom on the cheek, and hustled out of the house.
I met Dave in the front yard.  “Welcome home, bro!”
“Get out of my way, asshole.”  He pushed his way past me, purposely butting my shoulder with his.  
We were very close.
